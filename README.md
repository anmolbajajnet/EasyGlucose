# EasyGlucose

Welcome! 

This is the initial documentation for our application, we will be documenting our classes and important functions in this readme file.

<b>Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L98STTfdX8c&frags=pl%2Cwn</b>

Only push code to this repository if it builds without any warnings or error. DO NOT push if the build fails.

Steps:

1) Pull to your local computer
2) Install cocoapods. Cocoa is Apple’s Application Programming Interface (API) for its operating system iOS and macOS. iOS applications rely on many Cocoa libraries to be fully functional. 
We plan to use the popular “Cocoa Dependency Manager” called CocoaPods. It’s a powerful tool
that “resolves dependencies between libraries, fetches source code for all dependencies, and
creates and maintains an Xcode workspace.”.
  - Locate the application folder from the Terminal
  - enter the 'pod install' command
  - always open the .xcworkspace file, NOT the .xcodeproj
3) Select iPhone SE as the phone model for the application works best on small screen, budget-friendly phone.

For Realm => https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/ this is extremely helpful! Realm is a cross-platform mobile database solution designed for mobile applications that you can integrate with your iOS projects.
